# UX Engineer Homework Assignment

Showcase your design skills by applying CSS styles to a simple article card component,
then augment it by adding a comments counter element. Feel free to use your UX expertise
and recommend UI improvements.

## Minimal Requirements

- Add CSS styles to `styles.css`
- Add comments counter element in `index.html` with associated styles in `styles.css`


## How will you assess my project?

I'm glad you asked! We will consider all of the following when "grading" your code sample:

- Fulfilling minimal requirements.
- Going beyond minimal requirements.
- Organization of code (CSS / HTML).
- Detail of design.


## How much time should I spend on this?

No more than 3 hours in total. We are not interested in derailing your life. Instead,
we would like to get a sense of how you are able to pair your design and technical skills.


## How should I submit my code?

Several options:
1. Use "git", and zip up the entire project directory (including the .git sub directory) and submit it to your recruiter.
2. Create a private git repository (on GitLab or GitHub for example) and provide access to the development team and recruiters
3. Create a private CodePen (or similar service) and provide access to the development team and recruiter.
